            <b>100% Attendance is mandatory</b>, especially for those in a position of authority. 
            If you don't come to drill, it disrupts the entire operation in a way that someone else must carry your load. 
            Requests for time off must be made through the chain of command. 
            If you don't know what the chain of command is, you probably missed drill. 
            All requests must be approved in writing by the Commanding Officer or your absence will be marked unexcused. 
            Our goal is to provide the best training available to help you to prepare for your future, and to prepare as a team.
