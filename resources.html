                  The mission of the sea cadets is to build leaders of character, and an indicator of good leadership is good communication. 
                  Your role as a cadet and student will require that you understand how to craft a formal message in the form of an email. 
                  Learn how to write an email to an officer today. 
                </p>

                <h3>1. Is it necessary?</h3>
                <p>
                  Before you start writing an email to an officer, ask yourself if the email you're about to write:

                  <ul>
                    <li>can be answered by Google;</li>
                    <li>can be answered by information on Homeport/Polaris/Quarterdeck;</li>
                    <li>can be answered by greyghostdivision.org;</li>
                    <li>can be answered by your shipmates on Discord; or</li>
                    <li>can be answered by your squad leader/another staff cadet. </li>
                  </ul>
                  If the answer is yes, stop! It means you find the answer without the help of an officer. In general, send an email to an officer when one of the following applies: 
                  
                  you are asking for a letter of recommendation; 
                  you are following up on a private matter; 
                  you are asking about something urgent; or
                  you are informing an officer about something you believe should be kept in confidence.
                </p> 

                <h3>2. Recipient list and subject</h3>
                <p>
                  Enter the email address of the officer you intend to address in the "To" box. 
                  Then, enter the email addresses of one other officer and one of your parents in the "CC" box. 
                  Not sure what the email address of your officer is? Check the Chain of Command page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The subject line is an important part of an email; people get lots of email, so it's important to be clear and concise. 
                  Come up with a 2-5 word topic that summarizes your email. 
                  If you're asking for a letter of recommendation, call it "Letter of Recommendation Request." 
                  If you're confirming payment for your annual enrollment, call it "Annual Enrollment Payment Confirmation." 
                  Finally, add your rank and last name to the beginning of the subject line. 
                  Here's an example: 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>SN Lee Annual Enrollment Payment Confirmation</b>
                </p>

                <h3>3. Salutation</h3>
                <p>
                  The first line of your email greets the recipient. First impressions matter! 
                  Either use a time-of-day greeting, "Dear," or directly address the officer. Address the recipient by rank and last name. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>"Good morning Lieutenant Peach,"</b>
                  <b>"Dear XO Fullerton,"</b>
                  <b>"INST Chen,"</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These are all acceptable forms of a salutation. Use them to demonstrate your courtesies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>"Hey CO,"</b>
                  <b>"What's up Sir,"</b>
                  <b>"yo,"</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These are unacceptable forms of a salutation. Do not use them in emails to officers. 
                </p>

                <h3>4. Body</h3>
                <p>
                  Introduce your rank, name, and your billet, if applicable. Your email address might not be as recognizable as you think. 
                  
                  Get to the precise purpose(s) of your message as quickly as possible. Don't hesitate writing something like "I am writing to..."
                  
                  Just like the essays in English class, split up your email into paragraphs. In each paragraph, have a topic sentence, background/context, what you would like the officer to do, and wrap up. 
                  
                  Write in complete sentences; email writing is not texting. Avoid contractions. If you would not turn in your email as a formal English assignment, do not send the email. 

                  Proofread your email to make sure there are no grammar or spelling errors. 
                </p>

                <h3>5. Closing</h3>
                <p>
                  In accordance with military courtesies, sign off your email using "very respectfully," followed by your rank and full name. 
                  This is the appropriate closing when writing to seniors. On the other hand, "respectfully" is used when addressing juniors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Very respectfully,<br>
                  PO3 James Gatz</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When writing to an officer of a different unit, use this format instead: 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Very respectfully, James Gatz<br>
                  PO3 USNSCC<br>
                  Grey Ghost Division</b>
                </p>

                <h3>6. Following up</h3>
                <p>
                  If an officer hasn't responded for a week (or less, depending on the urgency of your message), it is reasonable to follow up. 
                  Chances are, the email got buried in the recipient's inbox. 
                  Staying in the same email chain, respectfully ask if the officer saw your message, and make sure to "Reply all" because of the "Two-Deep Policy."
                </p>

                <p class="mt-4">

                  <li>
                    Bulk is the distance that the mass of hair protrudes from the scalp. 
                    It must not exceed two inches.

                    Where the 3/4 inch taper at the back of the neck is not practicable, cut for a graduated appearance. This may combine the taper with a line at the back of the neck.

                  <li>
                    Members may cut, shave, or clip one natural, narrow, fore and aft part.

                    Hair length, when in uniform, may touch, but not fall below a horizontal 
                    line level with the lower edge of the back of the collar. With jumper uniforms, 
                    hair may extend a maximum of 1-1/2 inches below the top of the jumper collar.

                    Except for documented medical conditions, hair length must prevent the scalp from being readily visible.
